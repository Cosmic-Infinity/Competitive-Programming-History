A respository of my solutions to HackerRank problems. I solve some when I get time, or am too bored to do anything else.

## Inconsistencies

Most hackerrank solutions come with some pre written code. The code ranges from buffered reader and lists and maps to all sorts of weird things to get testcase input.

Sometimes I'm offended by the way they set up the input process, in which case I rewrite the whole program.
Other times I'm too tired to rewite everything and just write the logic part.

This introduces inconsistencies in the code, whereby some programs are small and easy to read, while others are an eye-sore with unnecessary imports and ...stuff.

Although, I strongly recommend against doing so, all solutions provided here are `Ctrl+C - Ctrl+V` worthy.
